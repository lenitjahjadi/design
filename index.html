		<h3>Persona Checklist</h3>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">1. Divide by their role
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>List down all the potential user roles for your product and categorise them.</p>

		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">2. Behaviour and demographic
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Find out the behaviour of each role. What behaviour is different from each other? Map out your interviewees response.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">3. Map it with the variable
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Draw a simple map and put their names according to their responses. Here's the sample of the map : </p>
		<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9b6374_47dfb95dfd734a4f9ca8f89d8cdc433d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1480,h_652,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/9b6374_47dfb95dfd734a4f9ca8f89d8cdc433d~mv2.webp" alt="Personamapping" width="500" height="220">
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">4. Find pattern
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Now that you have a map and the name of each interviewees, let’s try to find any recurring similarities. Circle any part with 2 or more names that are close to each other and happens frequently</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">5. Define Goal
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>From the response, keep asking “why?”. When there is an answer, ask “why?” again. Keep asking why until it is not possible to answer it. For example, one of your persona is often going to the mall, ask why.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">6. Clarify Distinctions
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Sometimes there are certain things that we have to pay attention to and take note. Sometimes these things appear during an interview, subtly or explicitly. For example, when your interviewees tend to speak in an uncomfortable manner to answer one particular question, take note of this. </p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">7. Fill In Other Persona Types As Needed
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>This step is probably the extra and optional step. It doesn’t really happen in several cases, but it does happen from time to time. Sometimes this happens when your stakeholders say that your product has both users and customers and you only did the user persona. Therefore, it’s time to make the customer persona as well. </p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">8. Group and Prioritise Persona
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Let’s group all the personas you have (if you happen to have more than 2 personas). Group them into 2 different groups : 
		<br>
		1.Primary
		<br>
		2.Secondary
		<br>
	Primary persona is the one you’d want to prioritise.  Typically, you'd want to design for this group first. Primary persona is the persona that when you design for them, it's most likely not going to mess with other personas' need. </p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">9. Do the Narrative
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Now here is the story telling part. From all the data you gathered, create a simple story about this persona and include their photo as well. Remember to focus on the main subject and don't add many fictious data such as the color of their car or the name of their dog.</p>
