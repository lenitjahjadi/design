		<h3>Persona Checklist</h3>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">1. Divide by their role
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Find out what are the tasks they perform</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">2. Behaviour and demographic
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Find out the behaviour of each role. What behaviour is different from each other? Map out your interviewees response.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">3. Map it with the variable
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Here, you should draw a simple map and put their names according to their responses.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">4. Find pattern
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Now that you have a clear map on your hand, let’s try to find any recurring similarities.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">5. Define Goal
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Here’s a simple way on how you can define a goal : keep asking “why?”. When there is an answer, ask “why?” again. Keep asking why until it is not possible to answer it.</p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">6. Clarify Distinctions
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Sometimes there are certain things that we have to pay attention to and take note. Sometimes these things appear during an interview, subtly or explicitly. </p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">7. Fill In Other Persona Types As Needed
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>This step is probably the extra and optional step. It doesn’t really happen in several cases, but it does happen from time to time. For example, if your stakeholders say that your product has both users and customers and you only did the user persona, it’s time to make the customer persona as well. </p>
		</label>
		<br>
		<br>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">8. Group and Prioritise Persona
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Let’s group all the personas you have (if you happen to have more than 2 personas). Group them into 2 different groups : 
		<br>
		1.Primary
		<br>
		2.Secondary
		<br>
	Primary persona is the one you’d want to prioritise.  Typically, you'd want to design for this group first. </p>
		</label>
		<label class="checkboxContainer">9. Do the Narrative
		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="checkmark"></span>
		<p>Now here is the story telling part. I am sure you have seen many published personas in this type of content. It is most likely because this is indeed the final part. This marks that you are done creating user persona. </p>
